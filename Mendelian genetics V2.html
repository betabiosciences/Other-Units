            <section id="section-1" class="section active">
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>The process of <strong>heredity</strong>, or how <strong>characters are passed from one generation to the next</strong>, along with the <strong>elementary principles involved</strong>, is a question we can answer today thanks to the pioneering work of <strong>Gregor Mendel</strong>.</p>
                <p>After becoming a priest, Mendel was sent from his monastery in Brno, Czech Republic, to the <strong>University of Vienna</strong> to study <strong>biology, physics, and mathematics</strong>. Returning to the Brno monastery to teach in <strong>1853</strong>, he began his experiments. He used a <strong>small plot of land</strong> at the monastery to conduct his plant-crossing experiments. Over a period of <strong>seven years</strong>, Mendel performed crosses involving <strong>thousands of plants</strong>.</p>
                <p>Mendel chose the <strong>common pea plant (Pisum sativum)</strong> for his studies to establish the fundamental principles of inheritance. However, his work was largely ignored by the scientific community, which mistakenly believed in a <strong>blending theory of inheritance</strong>. This incorrect theory proposed that parental traits would mix together, resulting in an <strong>intermediate physical appearance</strong> in the offspring.</p>
                <p>This "blending" idea <em>seemed</em> correct because of a phenomenon now known as <strong>continuous variation</strong>.</p>
            </section>
            
            <!-- Section 2: Continuous vs. Discontinuous Variation -->
            <section id="section-2" class="section">
                <h2>Continuous vs. Discontinuous Variation</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Continuous Variation:</strong> Results from the action of <strong>many genes</strong> (polygenic inheritance) determining a characteristic, like <strong>human height</strong>. Offspring appear to be a "<strong>blend</strong>" of their parents' traits, which lent false support to the blending theory.</li>
                    <li><strong>Discontinuous Variation:</strong> This is the type of variation Mendel studied. It involves traits that are inherited in <strong>distinct, separate classes</strong>, such as <strong>violet versus white flowers</strong>, with no intermediate forms. Working with these distinct classes allowed Mendel to uncover the true principles of inheritance, which contradicted the blending model.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Mendel's central belief was in <strong>particulate inheritance</strong>, proposing that <strong>heredity</strong> is the result of <strong>discrete, independent units</strong> (which he called "factors," now known as <strong>genes</strong>) within an individual's genome.</p>
                <p>He proposed <strong>three foundational principles of inheritance</strong>:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Concept of Dominance</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Law of Segregation</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Law of Independent Assortment</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p>Mendel presented his theories in two public lectures in <strong>1865</strong> and a detailed written publication in <strong>1866</strong>. Despite this, his work was <strong>ignored</strong> by the scientific mainstream until <strong>1900</strong>.</p>

            <!-- Section 3: Rediscovery and Application -->
            <section id="section-3" class="section">
                <h2>Rediscovery and Application</h2>
                <p>By the year 1900, the discovery of <strong>chromosomes</strong> led biologists to hypothesize that genes might be carried on these structures. When scientists finally read Mendel's work on particulate inheritance, they were able to make the crucial connection between <strong>genes</strong> (Mendel's factors) and <strong>chromosomes</strong>.</p>
                <p>Mendel's principles of inheritance, though initially established through experiments with pea plants, were found to be universally applicable to <strong>most other organisms, including humans</strong>. This broad applicability was critical for <strong>clinicians</strong>, allowing them to understand the <strong>genetic basis of human diseases</strong>. For instance, within a few years of the rediscovery of Mendel's work in 1900, <strong>Archibald Garrod</strong> successfully applied Mendel's principles to decipher the genetic cause of <strong>inborn errors of metabolism</strong>, such as <strong>alkaptonuria</strong> and <strong>phenylketonuria (PKU)</strong>.</p>

                <p>Mendel chose the <strong>pea plant (Pisum sativum)</strong>, which provided many advantages:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Easy Cultivation:</strong> They could be easily grown in small spaces, like the monastery garden and greenhouse he had available.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rapid Generation Time:</strong> They grow relatively fast, completing an entire generation within one growing season.</li>
                    <li><strong>Large Sample Size:</strong> Pea plants produce a <strong>large number of seeds (offspring)</strong>. A large progeny size is vital because it reduces the impact of chance, allowing for the drawing of meaningful, statistically sound results.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>2. Availability of Pure-Bred Varieties</h3>
                <p>Mendel had access to a <strong>large number of different pea varieties</strong>. Because peas naturally <strong>self-pollinate</strong>, these varieties were <strong>genetically pure</strong> (homozygous) for their traits, giving Mendel a defined and reliable starting point for his crosses.</p>
                <h3>3. Wise Selection of Traits</h3>
                <p>His choice of <strong>seven specific characteristics</strong> for study was crucial. Instead of traits that show a wide range of variation (<strong>continuous variation</strong>), he selected traits that exist in <strong>two distinct, easily distinguishable forms</strong> (<strong>discontinuous variation</strong>), such as tall vs. dwarf height, round vs. wrinkled seeds, and inflated vs. constricted pods.</p>
                <h3>4. Rigorous Scientific Methodology and Data Analysis</h3>
                <p>Mendel adopted a true <strong>scientific method</strong> to test his ideas, unlike previous investigators who merely described the results of crosses.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>He <strong>formulated hypotheses</strong> based on initial observations, and then performed further crosses specifically to <strong>test these hypotheses</strong>.</li>
                    <li>He kept <strong>meticulous records</strong> of the number of progeny showing each trait and <strong>calculated ratios</strong> of the different types.</li>
                    <li>His <strong>attention to detail</strong>, ability to <strong>see patterns in the data</strong>, and his <strong>patience</strong> were exemplary; he conducted his experiments for <strong>over seven years</strong> before publishing.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>5. Favorable Genetic Conditions</h3>
                <p>The specific characters Mendel selected were located on <strong>different chromosomes</strong>. Furthermore, all seven pairs of contrasting traits he studied exhibited <strong>complete dominance</strong>, which simplified the resulting patterns of inheritance and made them easier to track and analyze.</p>

                <h2>Mendel's Seven Traits</h2>
                <p>Mendel chose the common pea plant, <em>Pisum sativum</em>, for his studies and specifically focused on <strong>seven pairs of contrasting characteristics</strong>.</p>
                <p>The specialty of these selected characteristics was that they exhibited <strong>discontinuous variation</strong>, meaning they occurred in two distinct, easily distinguishable forms with <strong>no intermediate blending</strong>. This feature was crucial for Mendel's success, as it allowed him to observe and quantify the separate units of inheritance. Furthermore, all seven pairs of contrasting traits he studied exhibited <strong>complete dominance</strong>, which greatly simplified the inheritance patterns he observed.</p>
                <h3>Location of Mendel's Seven Traits on Pea Chromosomes</h3>
                <p>Mendel was fortunate in his selection, as his seven traits were controlled by genes located on only <strong>four</strong> of the pea plant's seven chromosome pairs (2n=14). These genes were either on different chromosomes or were located far enough apart on the same chromosome to effectively assort independently.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Initial Cross (P Generation):</strong> Mendel cross-fertilized a <strong>tall</strong> pea plant with a <strong>dwarf</strong> pea plant. To do this, he manually transferred pollen (male gametes) from one variety's anthers to the stigma (female part) of the other, ensuring a controlled cross.</li>
                    <li><strong>First Filial Generation (F1​):</strong> The resulting hybrid seeds, when grown, produced the F1​ generation. All these plants were <strong>uniformly tall</strong>.
                        <ul>
                            <li>The result was the same regardless of which parent provided the pollen (reciprocal crosses: tall male × dwarf female, or dwarf male × tall female).</li>
                            <li><strong>Key Observation:</strong> The <strong>dwarf characteristic seemed to disappear</strong> entirely.</li>
                        </ul>

                <h2>Mendel's Inferences and Genetic Concepts</h2>
                <p>Mendel's observations led him to propose the concept of <strong>particulate inheritance</strong> and two foundational principles:</p>
                <h3>1. The Concept of Dominance</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mendel inferred that the F1​ hybrids, though tall, must have carried a hidden genetic factor for dwarfness because they produced dwarf F2​ offspring.</li>
                    <li>He concluded that the factor for <strong>tallness was dominant</strong> (expressed) and <strong>masked</strong> the factor for <strong>dwarfness, which was recessive</strong> (latent).</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>2. The Principles of Inheritance (Genes and Alleles)</h3>
                <p>Mendel extended his findings to six other traits (seed texture, seed color, pod shape, etc.), consistently finding a <strong>3:1 ratio</strong> in the F2​ generation of all monohybrid crosses.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Genes and Alleles:</strong> Mendel referred to his heritable factors as <strong>"factors."</strong> Today, they are called <strong>genes</strong> (coined by Wilhelm Johannsen in 1909), and their alternate dominant and recessive forms are called <strong>alleles</strong>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gene Pairs:</strong> Mendel concluded that genes come in <strong>pairs</strong> (two copies).
                        <ul>
                            <li>The true-breeding parental plants were <strong>diploid and homozygous</strong> (carrying two identical copies, e.g., DD or dd).</li>
                            <li>Gametes (sperm and egg) are <strong>haploid</strong>, carrying only a single copy of the gene (D or d).</li>
                            <li>The F1​ hybrid offspring are <strong>heterozygous</strong> (carrying two different alleles, Dd), inheriting one from each parent.</li>
                        </ul>

                <h2>Symbolic Representation and F2 Analysis</h2>
                <p>Mendel pioneered the use of <strong>symbols</strong> to represent hereditary factors (alleles), enabling clear, mathematical analysis of crosses.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Genotype vs. Phenotype:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Genotype:</strong> The allelic constitution of an organism (DD, Dd, or dd).</li>

                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Symbol Use:</strong> The letter chosen typically relates to the recessive trait (e.g., <strong>d</strong> for dwarfness). The recessive allele is lowercase (<strong>d</strong>), and the dominant allele is uppercase (<strong>D</strong>).

                <p>The self-fertilization of F1​ heterozygotes (Dd) leads to four equally probable zygote combinations: DD, Dd, dD, and dd.</p>

                <h3>F3​ Confirmation</h3>
                <p>To confirm the genotypes, Mendel self-fertilized the F2​ plants:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>All dwarf F2​ plants (dd) produced only dwarf offspring (proven homozygous).</li>

                            <li>≈1/3 produced only tall offspring (proven to be DD <strong>homozygotes</strong>).</li>
                            <li>≈2/3 produced a mix of tall and dwarf offspring (proven to be Dd <strong>heterozygotes</strong>). This 1:2 ratio among the tall plants exactly matched his prediction.</li>

            <section id="section-9" class="section">
                <h2>Mendel's Two Key Principles</h2>
                <p>Mendel's monohybrid analysis is summarized by two principles:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>The Principle of Dominance:</strong> The <strong>Principle of Dominance</strong> describes how two different versions of a gene, called <strong>alleles</strong>, interact when they coexist in a <strong>heterozygote</strong> (an individual with one dominant and one recessive allele, e.g., Dd). This principle states that the <strong>dominant allele</strong> will completely <strong>mask or conceal</strong> the physical expression of the <strong>recessive allele</strong>. This is fundamentally a statement about <strong>genetic function</strong> at the molecular level. Typically, the dominant allele provides instructions for a functional product (like a key enzyme or protein), and having just one copy of this functional allele is usually enough to produce the trait's full phenotype (e.g., tallness or violet flower color). Conversely, the recessive allele often produces a non-functional or absent product. Because the single dominant allele compensates fully, the heterozygote (Dd) displays the dominant phenotype, identical to a homozygote (DD), while the recessive trait only appears when two copies of the non-functional recessive allele are present (dd).</li>
                    <li><strong>The Principle of Segregation:</strong> The <strong>Principle of Segregation</strong> is a core law of <strong>genetic transmission</strong> stating that the two different alleles a <strong>heterozygote</strong> possesses (e.g., D and d) must <strong>separate</strong> or <strong>segregate</strong> from each other when the organism forms gametes. This process ensures that <strong>each gamete receives only one allele</strong> (D or d) with equal probability, meaning the alleles are transmitted faithfully and discretely, rather than being blended. This principle is physically explained by <strong>meiosis</strong>, the cell division process for creating gametes, where the homologous chromosomes---on which the two alleles are located---physically <strong>separate</strong> during Anaphase I. Consequently, the two alleles are distributed into different gametes, allowing the hidden recessive trait to reappear in subsequent generations when two such recessive alleles reunite.</li>

                <p>The close agreement between the observed 9:3:3:1 ratio and the ratio predicted by this independent assortment model led to Mendel's third principle:</p>
                <h3>The Principle of Independent Assortment</h3>
                <p>The <strong>alleles of different genes</strong> (e.g., the G/g pair and the W/w pair) <strong>segregate, or assort, independently of each other</strong> during gamete formation. This is another rule of <strong>genetic transmission</strong>. It means that the inheritance of one trait (like seed color) does not influence the inheritance of another trait (like seed texture). The separation of the alleles for color is <strong>not linked</strong> to the separation of the alleles for texture. This principle is generally true, but it is physically explained by the <strong>independent behavior of different pairs of chromosomes</strong> during meiosis. However, it does not apply to all genes; genes that are located close together on the same chromosome are often <strong>linked</strong> and do not assort independently.</p>

            <section id="section-13" class="section">
                <h2>Physical Basis for Law of Segregation</h2>
                <p>The principles of heredity established by Mendel, though derived solely from his breeding experiments, are rooted in the physical behavior of <strong>chromosomes</strong> during meiosis.</p>
                <p>Prior to 1900, when Mendel's work was rediscovered, the physical nature and location of his "factors" (alleles) were unknown. Working independently in the early 1900s, <strong>Walter Sutton and Theodor Boveri</strong> proposed the <strong>Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance</strong>, concluding that <strong>genes are located on chromosomes</strong>.</p>
                <p>They observed that the behavior of <strong>homologous chromosome pairs</strong> during meiosis---specifically, their segregation into gametes---perfectly mirrored the segregation of Mendelian factors. This similarity led them to propose that Mendelian factors (alleles) physically <strong>reside on homologous chromosomes</strong>, providing the physical basis for heredity.</p>
                <p>In diploid organisms, cells contain <strong>homologous chromosomes</strong>---a pair of matching chromosomes, one inherited from the mother and one from the father. Similarly, diploid cells have <strong>two alleles</strong> at each gene locus, forming the genotype. The two alleles of a genotype are located at the <strong>same locus</strong> on this pair of homologous chromosomes.</p>
                <p>The symbols used in genetics (T,t,TT,Tt) are simply shorthand for the specific <strong>DNA sequences (alleles)</strong> found on these chromosomes that code for a phenotype.</p>
                <p>The separation of alleles is directly tied to the stages of meiosis:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Replication:</strong> Before meiosis, during the S stage of the cell cycle, each chromosome replicates, producing two identical sister chromatids. This means the alleles are also replicated, with one copy on each chromatid.</li>
                    <li><strong>Segregation in Meiosis I (No Crossing Over):</strong> If <strong>no crossing over</strong> occurs during Prophase I, the Mendelian factors (alleles) segregate during <strong>Anaphase I</strong>, when the <strong>homologous chromosomes separate</strong>. Each resulting cell gets one complete homologous chromosome, ensuring the separation of the two different alleles.</li>
                    <li><strong>Segregation in Meiosis II (With Crossing Over):</strong> If <strong>crossing over</strong> occurs during Prophase I, the sister chromatids are no longer genetically identical. In this case, the final separation of different alleles takes place during <strong>Anaphase II</strong>, when the <strong>sister chromatids separate</strong>.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Mendel's principles are therefore a direct consequence of the precise and predictable movements of chromosomes during gamete formation.</p>

                <h2>Physical Basis for Law of Independent Assortment</h2>
                <p>The principle of independent assortment, a key contributor to genetic variation, is physically rooted in <strong>Meiosis I</strong>.</p>
                <p>The foundation for independent assortment lies in the random alignment of <strong>homologous pairs</strong> (tetrads) during <strong>metaphase I</strong> on the metaphase plate.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This <strong>random orientation</strong> means that the segregation of one homologous pair is <strong>independent</strong> of all other pairs.</li>
                    <li>Consequently, when the homologous chromosomes separate during <strong>anaphase I</strong>, each resulting gamete can receive any combination of the <strong>paternal and maternal chromosomes</strong> (and the alleles they carry).</li>
                    <li>This independent segregation of chromosomes leads to a vast array of potential gametes. The number of different gamete types produced solely by independent assortment is 2<sup>n</sup>, where 'n' is the number of pairs of chromosomes. For instance, humans have 23 pairs, so an individual can produce 2<sup>23</sup> distinct types of gametes due to this mechanism alone, making independent assortment a major source of <strong>variation</strong> among offspring.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A crucial requirement for the principle of independent assortment to hold true is that it applies only to genes located on <strong>different chromosomes</strong>.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Chromosomes house hundreds or thousands of genes arranged linearly.</li>
                    <li>If genes are located on the <strong>same chromosome</strong>, they will generally <strong>travel together</strong> during anaphase I, ending up in the same pole and the same gamete.</li>
                    <li>Genes on the same chromosome therefore <strong>do not assort independently</strong> and exhibit <strong>linkage</strong>. This coupling will persist unless <strong>crossing over</strong> occurs between the genes during Meiosis I. If two linked genes are situated very far apart on the chromosome, crossing over may happen so frequently (in virtually every meiotic division) that they essentially appear to assort independently.</li>

                <h2>The Dihybrid Test Cross</h2>
                <p>A <strong>dihybrid test cross</strong> involves mating an <strong>F1​ individual that is heterozygous</strong> for two traits (Rr Yy) with an individual that is <strong>homozygous recessive</strong> for both traits (rr yy). This cross is essential because the homozygous recessive parent only contributes recessive alleles (ry) to its gametes, ensuring that the phenotype of the offspring directly reflects the allele combination contributed by the F1​ parent.</p>
