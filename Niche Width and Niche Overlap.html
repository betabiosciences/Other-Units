                <p class="mb-4">
                    An ecological niche is the specific role a species plays within its ecosystem. It is a multi-dimensional concept, representing all the environmental conditions and resources a species requires to survive, grow, and reproduce. This idea was famously conceptualized by G.E. Hutchinson as an <span class="accent-text">"n-dimensional hypervolume,"</span> where each dimension represents a different ecological factor, such as food type, temperature, pH, or light availability.

                <p class="mb-4">
                    There are two key components of a species' niche:

                        <span class="font-bold accent-text">Realized Niche:</span> The actual, more limited range of conditions and resources a species does use due to those interspecific interactions. The realized niche is always a subset of the fundamental niche, as competition and predation restrict a species' ability to exploit its full potential range.

                <p class="mb-4">
                    Niche width is a measure of a species' flexibility and its capacity to tolerate a range of environmental conditions and utilize various resources. It is the primary characteristic that distinguishes a specialist from a generalist species.
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-4 mb-4">

                        <span class="font-bold accent-text">Specialists:</span> These species have a narrow niche, highly adapted to a very specific set of conditions or resources. They are extremely efficient within their niche but are vulnerable to any changes in their specific environment or the disappearance of their key resources. The koala, which feeds almost exclusively on a few species of eucalyptus leaves, is a classic example. The giant panda, which relies almost entirely on bamboo, is another.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="font-bold accent-text">Generalists:</span> These species possess a broad niche and are able to utilize a wide variety of resources and live in many different environments. They are more adaptable to changing conditions but are often less efficient than a specialist at exploiting any single resource. A raccoon is an excellent example of a generalist, thriving in diverse habitats and consuming a wide range of food sources.

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 accent-text">Levins' Measure of Niche Width</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Levins' measure is a quantitative method to calculate niche breadth (B) based on the proportional use of resources. The formula is:
                </p>
                <p class="text-center font-mono text-lg bg-gray-700 p-3 rounded-md mb-4">
                    B = 1 / (Σ p<sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup>)
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Where p<sub>i</sub> is the proportion of individuals that use resource i, or the proportion of a population's diet composed of resource i. The denominator, Σ p<sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup>, is a measure of the concentration of resource use.
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-4 mb-4">
                    <li class="mb-2">
                        A <span class="font-bold accent-text">low B value</span> (closer to 1) indicates a narrow, specialized niche. This occurs when a species is heavily reliant on one or a few resources, making the p<sub>i</sub> for those resources high, which in turn makes the sum of squares large and the final B value small.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A <span class="font-bold accent-text">high B value</span> (closer to N, the total number of available resources) indicates a broad, generalist niche. This occurs when a species uses all available resources more or less equally, resulting in low, similar p<sub>i</sub> values and a small sum of squares, leading to a large B value.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 accent-text">Components of Niche Breadth</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Niche breadth can be divided into two main components based on how individuals within a population utilize resources:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-4 mb-4">
                    <li class="mb-2">
                        <span class="font-bold accent-text">Within-Phenotype Niche Breadth:</span> This occurs when every individual in a population uses the entire range of resources available to the species. There is no individual specialization; all individuals are generalists.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="font-bold accent-text">Between-Phenotype Niche Breadth:</span> This occurs when each individual in a population uses only a narrow part of the population's overall niche. This means there is high specialization among individuals, with different individuals or groups focusing on different parts of the resource spectrum.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 accent-text">Factors Influencing Niche Width</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    A species' niche width is not static and is shaped by several key ecological factors:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-4 mb-4">
                    <li class="mb-2">
                        <span class="font-bold accent-text">Environmental Stability:</span> Stable, predictable environments often favor specialists, as there is strong selective pressure to become highly efficient at exploiting a consistent, specific resource. In contrast, unstable or changing environments favor generalists, who are more adaptable to fluctuations.
                    </li>
                    <li class="mb-2">
                        <span class="font-bold accent-text">Resource Availability:</span> Limited resources can drive a species to become a specialist to avoid competition. Conversely, abundant and varied resources can support a generalist lifestyle.
                    </li>
                    <li class="mb-2">
                        <span class="font-bold accent-text">Competition:</span> Intense interspecific competition can force species to narrow their niche and specialize on a particular resource to avoid competitive exclusion. This is a key driver of resource partitioning.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="font-bold accent-text">Predation:</span> The presence of a dominant predator can also influence niche width. A species may broaden its niche to exploit resources in different habitats or at different times to avoid being preyed upon.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold section-title">III. Niche Overlap</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Niche overlap occurs when two or more species share a portion of the same niche, meaning they compete for the same limited resources like food, space, or light. The degree of overlap is directly proportional to the intensity of interspecific competition.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    The consequences of niche overlap can lead to one of three outcomes:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-4 mb-4">
                    <li class="mb-2">
                        <span class="font-bold accent-text">Competitive Exclusion:</span> This principle, also known as Gause's Law, states that two species cannot coexist indefinitely if they occupy the exact same niche. The superior competitor will eventually drive the other to local extinction. Classic laboratory experiments by G.F. Gause demonstrated this with two species of <span class="italic">Paramecium</span> competing for the same food source.
                    </li>
                    <li class="mb-2">
                        <span class="font-bold accent-text">Resource Partitioning:</span> This is a mechanism for coexistence where species with overlapping niches divide shared resources. This can happen through behavioral changes, such as feeding at different times or in different locations, which reduces the intensity of direct competition. A famous example is Robert MacArthur's study of warblers, which coexisted in the same tree species by foraging in different parts of the trees.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="font-bold accent-text">Character Displacement:</span> This is an evolutionary response to competition where species that overlap have evolved differences in traits to reduce competition. These differences are more pronounced in areas where the species coexist than where they live alone. The variation in beak sizes of Galápagos finches, which evolved to specialize on different seed sizes, is a well-known example of this phenomenon.
