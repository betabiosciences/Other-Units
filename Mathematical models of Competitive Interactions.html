            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The first mathematical models used to describe the outcomes of competition were provided in the 1920s by two people working independently: Alfred J. Lotka (1925), an insurance actuary who worked for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company in the United States, and Vito Volterra (1926), a professor of mathematical physics in Rome, Italy. Later, in the 1980s, David Tilman provided competition models based on patterns of resource use.</p>

        <div class="section" data-section="1">
            <h2>The Lotka-Volterra competition models</h2>
            <h3>The Foundation: The Logistic Equation</h3>
            <p>At its core, the Lotka-Volterra model builds upon the logistic growth equation, which describes how a single population grows in a limited environment.</p>
            <div class="math-equation">dN/dt = r N [(K − N) / K]</div>
            <p>This equation shows that a population's growth rate (dN/dt) slows down as its size (N) approaches the environment's carrying capacity (K). The term (K − N) represents the remaining "room" for population growth and is a measure of the negative effects of <strong>intraspecific competition</strong>—the competition among individuals of the same species.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Two Species Section (with images inserted as requested) -->
        <div class="section" data-section="2">
            <h2>Expanding to Two Species</h2>
            <p>To account for <strong>interspecific competition</strong> (competition between different species), Lotka and Volterra modified the logistic equation.</p>

            <!-- Image fig1 -->

            <p>They introduced <strong>competition coefficients</strong>, α and β, which quantify the competitive effect one species has on the other.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>α (alpha) is the per capita competitive effect of species 2 on species 1. It converts individuals of species 2 into an "equivalent" number of individuals of species 1 in terms of resource consumption. For example, if α = 0.5, it means two individuals of species 2 have the same competitive effect as one individual of species 1.</li>
                <li>β (beta) is the per capita competitive effect of species 1 on species 2. It does the same conversion, but from the perspective of species 2.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>β (beta) is the per capita competitive effect of species 1 on species 2. It does the same conversion, but from the perspective of species 2.</p>

            <p>These equations show that the growth rate of each species is now limited not only by its own population size (N1 or N2) but also by the population size of the competing species (N2 or N1), scaled by the competition coefficient.</p>

            <h2>Predicting Outcomes with Isoclines</h2>
            <p>The most powerful aspect of the Lotka-Volterra model is its ability to predict the long-term outcome of competition. This is done by plotting <strong>zero growth isoclines</strong>—lines on a graph where the growth rate of one of the species is zero.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The isocline for species 1 shows all combinations of N1 and N2 where dN1/dt = 0.</li>

            </ul>

            <p>By plotting both isoclines on the same graph, their relative positions reveal the four possible outcomes of competition:</p>

        <div class="section" data-section="4">
            <h2>Interpretation of Competition Outcomes</h2>
            <p><strong>Species 2 is eliminated:</strong> The isocline for species 1 (dN1/dt = 0) is located outside (to the right of) the isocline for species 2 (dN2/dt = 0). Species 1 is a stronger competitor and always wins, leading to the competitive exclusion of species 2.</p>
            <p><strong>Species 1 is eliminated:</strong> The isocline for species 2 (dN2/dt = 0) is located outside (above) the isocline for species 1 (dN1/dt = 0). Species 2 is the stronger competitor and always wins, leading to the competitive exclusion of species 1.</p>
            <p><strong>Either species eliminated (unstable equilibrium):</strong> The isoclines cross each other, but the equilibrium point where they intersect is unstable. Interspecific competition is stronger than intraspecific competition for both species. The outcome is competitive exclusion, but the winner is determined by the initial conditions.</p>
            <p><strong>Both species coexist (stable equilibrium):</strong> The isoclines cross, and the intersection point is a stable equilibrium point. Intraspecific competition is stronger than interspecific competition for both species. Both species can coexist at a stable equilibrium.</p>

        <!-- Crombie Experiment Section -->
        <div class="section" data-section="5">
            <h2>A.C. Crombie's Beetle Experiment</h2>
            <p>A classic experiment by A.C. Crombie in 1946 demonstrated the practical application of the Lotka-Volterra model. Crombie studied competition between two species of grain beetles, <em>Tribolium confusum</em> and <em>Oryzaephilus surinamensis</em>.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>In fine-grained flour:</strong> <em>Tribolium</em> preyed on the pupae of <em>Oryzaephilus</em>, effectively driving the latter to extinction. This outcome aligns with one of the competitive exclusion scenarios predicted by the model.</li>
                <li><strong>In whole wheat:</strong> The larger grains provided a refuge for the <em>Oryzaephilus</em> pupae, protecting them from predation by <em>Tribolium</em>. This protection reduced the interspecific competitive effect. As a result, coexistence was observed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Crombie was able to quantify this observation by measuring the carrying capacities (K1, K2) and competition coefficients (α, β) for the beetles in the whole wheat environment. By plotting the zero growth isoclines based on these measurements, he found that their relative positions perfectly matched the theoretical prediction for <strong>stable coexistence</strong>. He further validated this by starting experiments with different initial beetle densities. In every case, regardless of the starting numbers, the populations eventually stabilized at a predictable equilibrium point—approximately 375 <em>Tribolium</em> and 180 <em>Oryzaephilus</em>—confirming the model's predictive power. This experiment provided strong empirical support for the Lotka-Volterra model as a tool for understanding and predicting the outcomes of competition in real-world ecological systems.</p>

            <h2>Tilman's R* models</h2>
            <h3>The Problem with Earlier Models</h3>
            <p>The Lotka-Volterra models, while foundational, are considered phenomenological. This means they describe the outcome of competition without specifying the underlying cause. They use mathematical coefficients (α, β) to represent the competitive effect, but they don't explain <em>why</em> one species is a better competitor. David Tilman argued that to make truly predictive models, ecologists must understand the specific <strong>mechanisms</strong> of competition. His R* concept provides this mechanistic foundation by focusing on resource availability and use.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- R* Concept Section -->
        <div class="section" data-section="7">
            <h2>The R* (R-star) Concept: The Minimum Resource Requirement</h2>
            <p>At its heart, the R* model posits that competition is driven by a species' ability to acquire a limiting resource. R* represents the equilibrium point for a given resource. It is defined as the minimum concentration of a single limiting resource that a population needs to maintain a stable, non-declining population size.</p>
            <p>Think of it as a metabolic threshold. A population needs a certain amount of a resource (like nitrogen for plants or silicate for diatoms) to grow. However, individuals also die from various causes like being eaten, disease, or extreme weather. When the per capita growth rate, which depends on resource availability, equals the per capita death rate, the population size remains constant. The resource level at which this occurs is the species' R*.</p>

            <!-- Image fig8 -->
            <img class="figure" src="https://betabiosciences.github.io//Other-Units/MATHEMATICAL%20MODELS%20OF%20COMPETITIVE%20INTERACTIONS%20fig8.jpg" alt="Figure 8: R* concept illustration">

            <ul>
                <li>If the resource level is <strong>above</strong> a species' R*, the population's growth rate is positive, and its population size will increase.</li>
                <li>If the resource level is <strong>below</strong> a species' R*, its death rate exceeds its growth rate, and the population will decline toward extinction.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Competitive Exclusion Principle Section -->
        <div class="section" data-section="8">
            <h2>The Principle of Competitive Exclusion</h2>
            <p>The R* concept leads to a powerful and simple prediction: <strong>for a single limiting resource, the species with the lowest R* will be the superior competitor.</strong></p>
            <p>Here's why: Imagine two species, A and B, competing for the same resource. Let's say Species A has a lower R* than Species B. As both populations grow, they consume the resource, causing its concentration to drop. Species A can continue to grow even as the resource becomes scarce. It will drive the resource concentration down to its own R*, which is a level too low for Species B to survive. Since Species B cannot grow or even maintain its population at this low resource level, it will eventually go extinct. Species A will then monopolize the habitat, having excluded Species B.</p>
            <p>This principle was dramatically demonstrated in Tilman's classic experiment with diatoms. He showed that <em>Synedra ulna</em> had a lower R* for silicate than <em>Asterionella formosa</em>. As a result, <em>Synedra</em> was able to outcompete and exclude <em>Asterionella</em> from the laboratory cultures. This provided strong empirical evidence that the R* model's predictions hold true under controlled conditions.</p>

            <h2>Coexistence in a Complex World</h2>
            <p>While the R* model elegantly predicts competitive exclusion for a single limiting resource, it also helps to explain why so many species coexist in nature. The natural world is rarely as simple as a single limiting resource.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Multiple Limiting Resources:</strong> Most ecosystems have multiple resources that can limit growth (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus, light, water). A species that is a great competitor for nitrogen might be a poor competitor for phosphorus. In a dynamic environment, no single species can have the lowest R* for all resources, allowing for a complex balance and coexistence. This is the basis for the <strong>resource ratio hypothesis</strong>, a major extension of Tilman's work.</li>
                <li><strong>Spatial and Temporal Heterogeneity:</strong> Resource availability is not constant. It varies across landscapes and over time. A species that is outcompeted in one area might be the superior competitor in another due to soil type, light availability, or water levels. Furthermore, a species that is dominant during a wet season might be outcompeted by another during a dry season. This constant fluctuation and spatial patchiness prevent any one species from winning everywhere and all the time.</li>
                <li><strong>Dispersal and Metapopulations:</strong> Species might persist in a habitat even if they are being outcompeted there, as long as they are regularly supplied with new individuals from a source population where they are the superior competitor. This constant dispersal can "rescue" a population from local extinction, allowing it to persist in a broader landscape.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Diatom Competition Experiment Results</h2>
            <p>The experiment displays five graphs detailing the competition between two species of diatoms, Asterionella and Synedra, for the nutrient silicate. The results demonstrate:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Asterionella alone:</strong> When grown by itself, Asterionella's population rapidly increases, reaching a stable density around day 20. Simultaneously, the silicate concentration decreases from an initial high level to a stable, low level.</li>
                <li><strong>Synedra alone:</strong> Similarly, when grown alone, Synedra's population increases and then stabilizes. The silicate concentration also decreases to a stable, low level, but this level is lower than the one observed with Asterionella.</li>
                <li><strong>High starting densities of both species:</strong> When both species are grown together with a high initial population, Synedra's population remains high and stable, while Asterionella's population sharply declines to near zero.</li>
                <li><strong>High starting density of Asterionella:</strong> Asterionella begins with a high density and Synedra with a low density. The outcome is similar: Asterionella's population decreases significantly, while Synedra's population increases and stabilizes.</li>
                <li><strong>High starting density of Synedra:</strong> Synedra starts with a high density and Asterionella with a low density. Synedra's population remains high, while Asterionella's population declines to zero.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In summary, the graphs demonstrate that Synedra is the superior competitor for silicate. It is able to reduce the silicate concentration to a lower level than Asterionella can on its own. Regardless of the starting population densities, when the two species are grown together, Synedra outcompetes Asterionella, leading to the near-total disappearance of the Asterionella population.</p>
